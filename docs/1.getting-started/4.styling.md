# Styling

Nuxt is highly flexible when it comes to styling. Write your own styles, or reference local and external stylesheet.
You can use CSS preprocessors, CSS frameworks, UI libraries, as well as Nuxt modules.

## Local Stylesheets

To add a local stylesheet, you can use the css property in the Nuxt configuration.
The natural place for your stylesheets if the `assets/` directory. You can then references its path and Nuxt will include it to all the pages of your application.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['~/assets/css/main.css']
})
```

You can also reference stylesheets that are distributed through npm. Let's use the popular `animate.css` library as an example.

```bash
npm install animate.css
```

This package recommends that you use a javascript import statement to include it in your application. In Nuxt, you don't need to do that.
The package can just be referenced directly as a string in the css property of your Nuxt configuration.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['animate.css']
})
```

### Importing in components

You can import stylesheets in your pages and components directly, either using a javascript import or a css `@import` statement.
You can learn more about css imports in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import).

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script>
import '~/assets/css/first.css'
</script>
<style>
@import url("~/assets/css/second.css");
</style>
```

::alert{type=info}
Keep in mind that CSS imported like this will be injected globally. When the component is Loaded.
::

### Working with Fonts

Place your local fonts files in the `assets/` directory. You can then reference them in your stylesheets using `url()`.

```css [assets/css/main.css]
@font-face {
  font-family: 'FarAwayGalaxy';
  src: url('../fonts/FarAwayGalaxy.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Then reference your fonts by name in your stylesheets, pages or components :

```html
<style>
h1 {
  font-family: 'FarAwayGalaxy', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```

## External Stylesheets

You can include external stylesheets in your application by adding a link element in the head section of your nuxt.config file.
You can achieve this result using different methods.

You can manipulate the head with the `app.head` property of your Nuxt Configuration :

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      link: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css" }]
    }
}})
```

### Dynamically adding Styleshets at runtime

You can use the useHead composable to dynamically set a value in your head in your runtime code.

::ReadMore{link="/docs/api/composables/use-head"}
::

```ts
useHead({
  link: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css" }]
})
```

Nuxt uses `unhead` under the hood, therefore you can refer to it's full documentation [here](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/).

### Modifying the head with a Nitro Plugin

If you need more advanced control, you can intercept the renderered html with a hook and modify the head programatically.

Create a plugin in `server/plugins/my-plugin.ts` like this :

```ts [server/plugins/my-plugin.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitro) => {
    nitro.hooks.hook("render:html", (html) => {
        html.head.push("<link rel ='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css'>")
    })
})
```

## Using Preprocessors

To use a preprocessor like SCSS, Sass, Less or Stylus, install it first.

::code-group

```bash [SASS & SCSS]
npm install sass
```

```bash [LESS]
npm install less
```

```bash [Stylus]
npm install stylus
```

::

The natural place to write your stylesheets is the `assets` directory.

If you need to add styles globally, like with color variables, you can use a [sass partial](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#partials) (or it's equivalent for your favorite preprocessor) and the vite [preprocessors options](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#css-preprocessoroptions).

Create some partials in your `assets` directory :
::code-group

```scss [assets/_colors.scss]
$primary: #49240F;
$secondary: #E4A79D;
```

```sass [assets/_colors.sass]
$primary: #49240F
$secondary: #E4A79D
```

::

Then in your `nuxt.config` :

::code-group

```ts [SCSS]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        scss: {
          additionalData: '@use "@/assets/_colors.scss" as *;'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```ts [SASS]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        sass: {
          additionalData: '@use "@/assets/_colors.sass" as *\n'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

::

By default Nuxt use vite, if you wish to use webpack instead, refer to each pre-processor loader [documentation](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/).

## Single File Components (SFC) Styling Options

One of the best thing about Vue and SFC is how great it is at naturally dealing with styling. You can directly write CSS or pre-processor code in the style block of your components file, therefore you don't need to use something like CSS-in-JS. You should refer to the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html) for styling components in SFC.

### Dynamic styles with v-bind

You can reference JavaScript variable and expression within your style blocks with the v-bind function.
The binding will be dynamic, meaning that if the variable value changes, the style will be updated.

```html
<template>
  <div class="text">hello</div>
</template>

<script setup>
const color = ref("red")
</script>

<style>
.text {
  color: v-bind(color);
}
</style>
```

### Scoped styles

The scoped attribute allow you to style component in insolation. The styles declared with this attribute will only apply to this component.

```html
<style scoped>
.example {
  color: red;
}
</style>

<template>
  <div class="example">hi</div>
</template>
```

### CSS Modules

You can use [css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) with the module attribute.

```html
<template>
  <p :class="$style.red">This should be red</p>
</template>

<style module>
.red {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

### Preprocessor support

SFC style blocks support pre-processors syntax. Vite come with built-in support for .scss, .sass, .less, .styl and .stylus files without configuration. You just need to install them first, and they will be available directly in SFC with the lang attribute.

::code-group

```html [SCSS]
<style lang="scss">
  /* Write scss here */
</style>
```

```html [SASS]
<style lang="sass">
  /* Write sass here */
</style>
```

```html [LESS]
<style lang="less">
  /* Write less here */
</style>
```

```html [STYLUS]
<style lang="stylus">
  /* Write stylus here */
</style>
```

::

You can refere to the [vite css docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) and the [@vitejs/plugin-vue docs](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue).
For webpack users, refer to the [vue loader docs](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/).

## Using PostCSS

Nuxt comes with postcss built-in. You can configure it in your `nuxt.config` file.

```ts [nxut.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    postcss: {
      plugins: {
        'postcss-nested': {}
        "postcss-custom-media": {}
      }
    }
})
```

For proper syntax highlighting in SFC, you can use the postcss lang attribute.

```html
<style lang="postcss">
  /* Write stylus here */
</style>
```

By default, Nuxt comes with the following plugins already pre-configured :

- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import): Improves the `@import` rule
- [postcss-url](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-url) : Transform `url()` statements
- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) : Automatically add vendor prefixes
- [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) : Minification and purge

## Â Leveraging Layouts for Multiple Styles

If you need to style different parts of your application completely differently, you can use layouts.
Use different styles for different layouts.

```html
<template>
  <h1> Default Layout</h1>
  <slot />
</template>
<style>
.DefaultLayout {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

::ReadMore{link="docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts"}

## Third party libraries and modules

Nuxt isn't opinionated when it comes to styling and provides you with a wide variety of options. You can use any styling tool that you want, such as the popular [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The community and the Nuxt team have developped plenty of Nuxt modules to makes the integration easier.
Here's a non exhaustive list of modules that you can check-out to get started :

- [Uno CSS](https://nuxt.com/modules/unocss)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss)
- [Fontaine](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/fontaine)
- [Pinceau](https://pinceau.dev/)
- [NuxtLabs UI](https://nuxt.com/modules/nuxtlabs-ui)

Nuxt modules provide you with a good developer experience out of the box, but remember that if your favourite tool doesn't have a module, it doesn't mean that you can't use it with Nuxt! You can configure it yourself for your own project. Depending on the tool, you might need to use a [nuxt plugin](docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins), [make your own module](/docs/guide/going-further/modules). Share them with the [community](https://nuxt.com/modules) if you do!

### Easily load webfonts

You can use a 3rd party module such [unocss](https://unocss.dev/integrations/nuxt) which comes with a [web fonts presets](https://unocss.dev/presets/web-fonts) to conveniently load fonts from common providers such as google fonts.

## Advanced

### Transitions

Nuxt comes with the same Transition element that Vue has, and also has support for the experimental [View Transitions API](docs/getting-started/transitions#view-transitions-api-experimental).

::ReadMore{link="docs/features/transitions"}
::

### Font advanced optimization

If you need something more advanced, such as font metric fallbacks, you can create a Nuxt module to extend the build process or the Nuxt runtime.
You can have a look at the 3rd party module [Fontaine](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/fontaine) for an implementation example.

::alert{type="info"}
Always remember to take advantage of the various tools and techniques available in the Web ecosystem at large to make styling your application easier and more efficient. Whether you're using native CSS, a pre-processor, postcss, a UI library or a module, Nuxt has got you covered. Happy styling!
