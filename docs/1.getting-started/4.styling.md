# Styling

Nuxt is highly flexible when it comes to styling. Write your own styles within your components,  reference your own styles or external stylesheets.
You can use CSS preprocessors, CSS framework or UI libraries, as well as Nuxt modules.

## Local Stylesheets

To add a local stylesheet, you can use the css property in the Nuxt configuration.
The natural place for your stylesheets if the assets/ directory. You can then references its path and Nuxt will include it to all the pages of your application.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['~/assets/css/main.css']
})
```

You can also reference stylesheets that are distributed through npm. For example, if you install a package such as `animate.css` with the following command `npm install animate.css`, you can then reference it directly in your nuxt.config file. All stylesheets that can be added with a javascript import statement such as `import 'animate.css'` can just be referenced directly as a string in the css property of your Nuxt configuration.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ['animate.css']
})
```

### Importing in components

You can import stylesheets in your pages and components directly, either using a javascript import or a css `@import` statement.

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<script>
import '~/assets/css/first.css'
</script>
<style>
@import("~/assets/css/second.css");
</style>

```

### Working with Fonts

Place your local fonts files in the `assets/` directory. You can then reference them in your stylesheets using `url()`.

```css [assets/css/main.css]
@font-face {
  font-family: 'FarAwayGalaxy';
  src: url('../fonts/FarAwayGalaxy.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

Then reference them by name in your stylesheets, pages or components :

```html
<style>
h1 {
  font-family: 'DistantGalaxy', sans-serif;
}
</style>
```

## External Stylesheets

You can include external stylesheets in your application by adding a link element in the head section of your nuxt.config file.
There's several options for you to modify the head.

You can manipulate the head with the `app.head` property of your Nuxt Configuration :

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      link: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css" }]
    }
}})
```

### Dynamically adding Styleshets at runtime

You can use the useHead composable to dynamically set a value in your head in your runtime code.

::ReadMore{link="/docs/api/composables/use-head"}
::

```ts
useHead({
  link: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css" }]
})
```

Nuxt uses `unhead` under the hood, therefore you can refer to it's full documentation [here](https://unhead.harlanzw.com/).

### Modifying the head with a Nitro Plugin

If you need more advanced control, you can intercept the renderered html with a hook and modify the head programatically.

Create a plugin in `server/plugins/my-plugin.ts` like this :

```ts [server/plugins/my-plugin.ts]
export default defineNitroPlugin((nitro) => {
    nitro.hooks.hook("render:html", (html) => {
        html.head.push("<link rel ='stylesheet' href='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css'>")
    })
})
```

### Dynamic Stylesheets with useHead

For adding dynamic stylesheets, the `useHead` composable can be utilized in your code or in your components.

```vue
<script setup>
useHead(() => ({
  link: [
    { rel: 'stylesheet', href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap' }
  ]
}))
</script>
```

## Using Preprocessors

To use a preprocessor like SCSS or Less, install it first, then write your stylesheets in the `assets` directory.
If you need to add styles globally, like with color variables, you can use a [sass partial](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#partials) (or it's equivalent for your favorite preprocessor). This will be available everywhere in your app.

::code-group

```scss [assets/_colors.scss]
$primary: #49240F;
$secondary: #E4A79D;
```

```sass [assets/_colors.sass]
$primary: #49240F
$secondary: #E4A79D
```

::

In your `nuxt.config`

::code-group

```ts [SCSS]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        scss: {
          additionalData: '@use "@/assets/_colors.scss" as *;'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```ts [SASS]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vite: {
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        sass: {
          additionalData: '@use "@/assets/_colors.sass" as *\n'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Single File Components (SFC) Styling Options

You should refer to the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html) for styling components in SFC.

### Scoped styles

Use the scoped attribute. The styles declared in this component will only apply to it.

```html
<style scoped>
.example {
  color: red;
}
</style>

<template>
  <div class="example">hi</div>
</template>
```

### CSS Modules

Use the module attribute. Refer to the [css modules docs](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

```html
<template>
  <p :class="$style.red">This should be red</p>
</template>

<style module>
.red {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

### Dynamic styles with v-bind

```html
<template>
  <div class="text">hello</div>
</template>

<script setup>
const color = ref("red")
</script>

<style>
.text {
  color: v-bind(color);
}
</style>
```

### Preprocessor support

Vite does provide built-in support for .scss, .sass, .less, .styl and .stylus files.
This is available directly in SFC with the lang attribute.

::code-group

```html [SCSS]
<style lang="scss">
  /* Write scss here */
</style>
```

```html [SASS]
<style lang="sass">
  /* Write sass here */
</style>
```

```html [LESS]
<style lang="less">
  /* Write less here */
</style>
```

```html [STYLUS]
<style lang="stylus">
  /* Write stylus here */
</style>

::

For vite, please check out [vite css docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) and [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue).

For webpack have a look at [vue loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/) for a full list of options regarding SFC.

## Using PostCSS

Nuxt comes with postcss built-in. You can configure it in your nuxt.config file.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    postcss: {
      plugins: {
        'postcss-nested': {}
        "postcss-custom-media": {}
      }
    }
})
```

For proper syntax highlighting in SFC, you can use the postcss lang attribute.

```html
<style lang="postcss">
  /* Write stylus here */
</style>
```

By default, Nuxt comes with the following plugins already pre-configured :

- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import): Improves the `@import` rule
- [postcss-url](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-url) : Transform `url()` statements
- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) : Automatically add vendor prefixes
- [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) : Minification and purge

## Â Leveraging Layouts for Multiple Styles

If you need to have different parts of your application have completely different styles, you can use layouts.
You can use different styles for different layouts. You can import a different stylesheet from the `assets/` directory for each layout.

```html
<template>
  <h1> Default Layout</h1>
  <slot />
</template>

<script>
import '~/assets/css/default.css'
</script>
```

### Third party libraries and modules

Nuxt isn't opinionated when it comes to styling and provides you with a wide variety of options. You can use any popular styling tool such as [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The community and the Nuxt team have developped plenty of Nuxt modules to makes the integration easier.
Here's a short list of a modules that you can check-out to get started :

- [Tailwind CSS](https://nuxt.com/modules/tailwindcss)
- [Uno CSS](https://nuxt.com/modules/unocss)
- [NuxtLabs UI](https://nuxt.com/modules/nuxtlabs-ui)
- [Fontaine](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/fontaine)
- [Pinceau](https://pinceau.dev/)

Nuxt modules provide you with a good DX out of the box, but remember that if your favourite doesn't have a module, it doesn't mean that you can't use it with Nuxt. You can configure any tool that you want for your own project, and you can [make your own module](/docs/guide/going-further/modules) if you wish to share it with the community.

#### Easily load webfonts

You can use a 3rd party module such [unocss](https://unocss.dev/integrations/nuxt) which comes with a [web fonts presets](https://unocss.dev/presets/web-fonts) to conveniently load fonts from common providers such as google fonts.

#### Font advanced optimization

If you need something very advanced such as font metric fallbacks, you can create a Nuxt module to extend the build process or the Nuxt runtime.
You can have a look at the 3rd party module [Fontaine](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/fontaine) for an implementation example.

Always remember to take advantage of the various tools and techniques available in the Web ecosystem at large to make styling your application easier and more efficient. Whether you're using native CSS, a preprocessor, a CSS-in-JS solution, a UI library or a module, Nuxt has got you covered. Happy styling!
