# This Issue Needs A Valid Reproduction

We can't replicate the issue with the details that you provided. **Please add a reproduction so that we can investigate further.**

## Why was the \`needs-reproduction\` label added to this issue?

For our investigation, a reproduction is vital to pinpoint the origin of the problem.

Kindly use one of the templates provided below to generate a minimal reproduction :

ðŸ‘‰ https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz
ðŸ‘‰ https://codesandbox.io/s/github/nuxt/starter/v3-codesandbox

A public Github repository would also be acceptable.

Please ensure that the reproduction is as **minimal** as possible.
That implies you should **eliminate any code, files, and dependencies** that aren't directly related to the issue.

## Why was the \`needs-reproduction\` label not removed even after I included a link?

Make sure your link refers to a codebase that's open for access (e.g., not a private repository).
Links such as "[example.com](http://example.com/)", "n/a", "will add later", and so on are not acceptable -- we require a visible public codebase.
Refer to the previous section for acceptable links.

## What will occur if I fail to provide a sufficient minimal reproduction?

If the \`needs-reproduction\` labeled issues don't receive any substantial activity (e.g., new comments featuring a reproduction link), they will be closed by the maintainers.

## What can I do to assist if the issue matters to me but I didn't open it?

If you're facing the same problem, feel free to offer a minimal reproduction by following the previous instructions.
Moreover, you can react on the initial comment of the issue.

- Avoid commenting "I have the same issue" without providing reproduction steps or meaningful information.
- Please refrain from posting unhelpful messages such as "+1" on an issue, use reactions on the first comment instead.

## Why isn't my issue given prompt attention even though I believe my reproduction is satisfactory?

Our team is regularly scanning open issues for new comments.
Reacting on issues to indicate your interest can help us prioritize and tackle them more swiftly.

## I can provide a minimal reproduction for an issue that's already been closed

If you have a minimal reproduction for a closed issue, please post a comment on the issue with the reproduction link.
We will review it and reopen the issue if it is sufficient.
